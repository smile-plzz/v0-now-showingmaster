- **Additional Problem (Landing Page Only)**: On first load, cards appeared misaligned or with inconsistent heights until navigating away and back
- **Solutions**:
  - Implemented comprehensive responsive grid system
  - Removed initial forced image refresh that was causing DOM reflows
  - Ensured images have intrinsic dimensions (2:3) to stabilize layout before load
  - Updated refresh logic to replace images in-place within `.movie-card-image-container`
  - Normalized grid and card heights for consistent nth-of-type alignment
- **Changes**:
  - Added responsive breakpoints (1200px, 768px, 480px, 360px)
